# The Role of Machine Learning in Predicting Diabetes

Diabetes is a major health concern in the United States and Canada, as well as globally, affecting millions of individuals.
Early prediction and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes, reduce complications, and improve
quality of life. Traditional statistical methods have limitations in identifying complex relationships within patient data.
Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, offers a more advanced way to detect and predict diabetes based on health
data, providing improved accuracy in risk detection. This research aims to utilize ML techniques to enhance diabetes
prediction, focusing on leveraging patient health information for predictive modeling.
This study evaluates three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost—to determine
which is best suited for diabetes prediction.

The research focuses on the following questions:
- How effective are machine learning models in predicting diabetes using patient health data?
- Which machine learning model—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or XGBoost—delivers the highest accuracy?
- What are the most significant factors influencing diabetes risk, and how do they impact prediction?

By answering these questions, this study aims to provide insights into the strengths of machine learning in healthcare
and its potential for enhancing early diabetes detection.
